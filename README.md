# webcrypto-core
We have created a number of WebCrypto polyfills including: [node-webcrypto-ossl](https://github.com/PeculiarVentures/node-webcrypto-ossl), [node-webcrypto-p11](https://github.com/PeculiarVentures/node-webcrypto-p11), and [webcrypto-liner](https://github.com/PeculiarVentures/webcrypto-liner).  `webcrypto-core` was designed to be a common layer to be used by all of these libraries for input validation.

Unless you intend to create a WebCrypto polyfill this library is probably not useful to you.
